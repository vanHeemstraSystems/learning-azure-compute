This application has a traditional 3-tier configuration using SQL Server as the data store. The IT team hopes you can help modernize the application. They have provided this diagram and several areas that could be improved.\n\n\n\nCompute\n\n\n\nThe frontend application is a .NET core-based web app. During peak periods 1750 customers visit the website each hour.\nThe application runs on IIS web servers in a front-end tier. This tier handles all customer requests for purchasing products. During the latest holiday sale, the front-end servers reached their performance limits and page loads were lengthy. The IT team has considered adding more servers, but during off hours the servers are often idle.\nThe middle tier hosts the business logic that processes customer requests. These requests are often for help desk support. Support requests are queued and lately the wait times have been very long. Customers are offered email rather than wait for a representative. But many customers seem frustrated and are disconnecting rather than wait. Customer requests are 75-125 per hour.\nThe back-end tier uses SQL Server database to store customer orders. Currently, the back-end database servers are performing well.\nWhile high availability is a concern, due to legal requirements the company must keep all the resources in a single region.\n\nTasks\n\nFront-end tier.
