# When to use Azure Batch
Azure Batch enables large-scale parallel and HPC batch jobs

- Compute-intensive tasks anbd dynamically adjust resources for your solution without managing infrastructure.
- Create and manage jobs in a pool of compute nodes (virtual machines).
- Azure Batch can also install the application that you want to run, and schedule jobs to run on the compute nodes.

# How Azure Batch works

Think of the diagram in two parts:
- **Your service** that uses Azure as the platform.
- **Batch as the compute platform behind your service**. Batch uses Azure Storage to fetch applications or data needed to complete a task.

Considerations:

- Pools- dynamically allocate jobs, right size the pools.
- Nodes - use multiple nodes in the pool, right size the machines.
- Jobs - uniquely name the jobs, monitor and log activity.
