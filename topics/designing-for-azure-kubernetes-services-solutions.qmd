# When to use Azure Kubernetes Services
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) orchestrates your containerized applications.

- Enterprise scalability.
- Automatic cluster node and pod scaling.
- Granular network control.
- Cluster node upgrades.
- Storage volume support.
- Ingress with HTTP application routing support.
- Private container registry support.

# Design a highly available container solution
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides high availability using multiple nodes in a virtual machine scale set.

When planning to implement AKS clusters across multiple region deployments, consider the following:

- AKS region availability.
- Azure paired regions.
- Service availability.

Two ways to synchronize storage:

- Infrastructure-based asynchronous replication.
- Application-based asynchronous replication.
