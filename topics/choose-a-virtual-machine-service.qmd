# When to select virtual machines
Know when to use vrtual machines.

- Quickly test and troubleshoot different configurations.
- Use speciality hardware such as high-performance computing.
- Extend your on-premises datacenter without purchasing additional hardware.
- Run legacy apps on modern hardware.
- Access third party software that requires local add-ons or plug-ins.
- Quickly migrate apps to the cloud.
- Fully control the computing environment.

# Plan the Azure virtual machine deployment
Azure virtual machines scenarios include build new or migrate patterns.

- Start with the network.
- Name the VM.
- Decide the VM location.
- Select the VM storage.
- Select a VM operating system.
- Keep the VM up-to-date.
- Monitor the VM.

# Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints
See also [Azure Subscription Service Limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits).

# When to select virtual machine scale sets
Scale sete are built from virtual machines. With scale sets, the management and automation layers are provided to run and scale your applications.

|Scenario|Group of virtual machines|Virtual machine scale sets*|
|--|--|--|
|You need to add VM instances for changing workload|Manual process to create, configure, and ensure compliance.|Automatically create from central configuration.|
|You need to balance and distribute workloads.|Manual process to create and configure Azure load balancer or Application Gateway.|Can automatically create and integrate with Azure load balancer or Application Gateway.|
|You need high availability and redundancy.|Manually create Availability Set or distribute and track VMs across Availability Zones.|Automatic distribution of VM instances across Availability Zone (when zones are selected) and Availability Set.|
|You need to monitor and then scale virtual machines.|Manual monitoring and Azure Automation.|Autoscale based on host metrics, in-guest metrics, Application Insights, or schedule.|

* Ensure the application supports Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS).
